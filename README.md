## Overview
The real estate market is also freezing due to the recent prolonged high interest rates and economic recession. Originally, real estate implementation projects took a long period of time, so it was difficult for both investors and developers to quickly cash out when insufficient capital was issued as stocks as was previously done. However, if it is issued as ST (Security Token) rather than stocks, easier and faster fund circulation can be expected. By issuing and selling insufficient capital as ST (security tokens) and listing the issued ST (security tokens) on the exchange at the same time as starting the business, it is possible to shorten the period of visible profit for investors and developers.
The FOGNET platform using PBCN INC.'s FOG coin is a real estate ST (security token) platform based on the Ethereum blockchain network that allows the execution rights of real estate development projects to be issued and traded as ST (security tokens). It can also be called a new concept of real estate development financing (Project Financing), a financial technique that raises funds using the business performance and future cash flow of a real estate development project as collateral, using ST (security tokens) as a medium.
The FOGNET platform ecosystem forms a token economy that connects FOGNET Token (FOG), the key currency and basic payment method required for various activities in the ecosystem, not only to real estate investment but also to the real economy such as K-POP auditions.

FOGNET Token (FOG) uses the standard token specification ERC-20 standard set by the Ethereum blockchain network in consideration of transaction stability and scalability, and ST (security token), which is a major asset with high contribution to the token economy, it uses the standard token specifications ERC-721 or ERC-1155 standards set by the Ethereum blockchain network. By holding ST (security tokens), users become eligible to participate as members of the FOGNET Platform ecosystem and exercise profit dividend rights.
FOGNET is a project that uses security tokens and utility tokens to build a blockchain-based platform that creates an ecosystem where people can participate in real estate execution and sales, and forms a token economy through this. We plan to discover real estate security tokens that can be commercialized in the future and create a healthy security token trading ecosystem based on real assets, and we plan to expand our services and business areas through the advancement and stabilization stages of the FOGNET platform.
